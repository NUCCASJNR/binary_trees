## Binary Trees

## Brief introduction to binary trees

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Each node in a binary tree stores some data, which can be any type of object depending on the application.

The first node of the binary tree is known as the root, and all other nodes are either a left or right child of the root or of another node in the tree. Nodes that have no children are called leaf nodes, while nodes that have one or more children are called internal nodes.

Binary trees are commonly used in computer science for a wide range of applications, including data storage and searching algorithms. They can be used to implement binary search algorithms, which can efficiently search for a particular item in a sorted list of data. Binary trees are also used in parsing and expression evaluation algorithms, and in building decision trees for machine learning algorithms.
